// The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the string representing x. 
// 
// The process I went through here is that I knew I could convert the integer to a string, and compare itself with its
// reversed string, making the overall time complexity O(n). Here is the breakdown of my code:
//     1. I start by initializing the temp string which I will be used at the end of the code.
//     2. Then I open a for loop which will loop through all characters of the string version of x.
//     3. In the for loop, I add to the temp string all characters from the string version of x but in reverse.
//     4. Finally I return the boolean expression comparing the string version of x and its reversed string temp.
