This repository holds a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems coded in JavaScript, Python, C#, and C++, accompanied by comments explaining my process.

I try my best to solve the solutions in the best overall time complexity it can be solved in. 


--------------------------- Here are all the problems I've solve thus far in LeetCode ---------------------------
  1) Two Sum (Easy); Languages: | JavaScript | Python | C# |; Best overall time complexity: O(n);
  66) Plus One (Easy); Languages: | Python |; Best overall time complexity: O(n);
